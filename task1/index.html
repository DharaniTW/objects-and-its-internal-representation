    <h1>Object and its internal representation in javascript</h1>
    <p>objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, 
        in the context of an object.
    </p>
    <p>For Eg. If your object is a student, it will have properties like 
        name, age, address, id, etc and methods like updateAddress, updateNam, etc.
    </p>
    <p>Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
        An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. 
        That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.
    </p>
    <h2>Object and properties</h2>
    <p>A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object. Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects. The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object. You access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation:
    </p>
        <p>objectName.propertyName</p>
     <h3>Creating Objects in Javascript:</h3>   
     <h4>Create javascript object with object literal</h4>
     <p>One of easiest way to create a javascript object is object literal, simply define the property 
         and values inside curly braces as shown below</p>
     <p><b>let bike = {name: 'SuperSport', maker:'Ducati', engine:'937cc'};</b></p>       
     <h5>Create Javascript Object with Constructor</h5>
     <p>constructor is nothing but a function and with help of new keyword, constructor function allows to create multiple objects of same flavor as shown below</p>

    <h6>Using the javascript keyword new</h6>
    <p>The following example also creates a new JavaScript object :</p>
